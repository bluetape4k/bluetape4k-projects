# The Zen of Python (PEP 20)

> Source: https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/

Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.

## The 19 Aphorisms

1. **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
    - Write elegant, readable code

2. **Explicit is better than implicit.**
    - Don't hide behavior; make intentions clear

3. **Simple is better than complex.**
    - Choose straightforward solutions

4. **Complex is better than complicated.**
    - When complexity is needed, keep it manageable

5. **Flat is better than nested.**
    - Avoid deep nesting; keep structures flat

6. **Sparse is better than dense.**
    - Don't pack too much into one line

7. **Readability counts.**
    - Code is read more often than written

8. **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**
    - Consistency matters

9. **Although practicality beats purity.**
    - Be pragmatic when needed

10. **Errors should never pass silently.**
    - Handle or propagate errors explicitly

11. **Unless explicitly silenced.**
    - Intentional suppression is acceptable

12. **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.**
    - Ask for clarification; don't assume

13. **There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.**
    - Python favors one canonical approach

14. **Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.**
    - (A nod to Guido van Rossum)

15. **Now is better than never.**
    - Don't over-plan; start implementing

16. **Although never is often better than *right* now.**
    - But don't rush without thought

17. **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.**
    - Complexity is a warning sign

18. **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**
    - Simplicity suggests good design

19. **Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!**
    - Organize code into clear namespaces

## Application

When writing Python code, ask yourself:

- Is this beautiful or ugly?
- Is this explicit or implicit?
- Is this simple or complex?
- Is this readable?
- Could I easily explain this to someone else?

The Zen of Python is not just style guidance—it's a philosophy for writing maintainable, understandable code.
